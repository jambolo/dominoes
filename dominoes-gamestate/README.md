# Dominoes GameState Crate

This crate provides a concrete implementation of game state management specifically designed for dominoes games, built on top of the base `GameState` crate.

## Overview

The dominoes-gamestate crate defines:

- `DominoesGameState`: A concrete implementation that wraps and extends the base GameState for dominoes-specific functionality

## Features

- **Dominoes-Specific State Management**: Extends the base GameState with dominoes game logic
- **Game Setup**: Methods for initializing dominoes games
- **Player Management**: Track current players and turns
- **Board State**: Manage the dominoes board and player hands
- **Game Rules**: Validate moves and determine game completion
- **Stub Implementation**: Ready for dominoes-specific logic implementation

## Usage

```rust
use dominoes_gamestate::DominoesGameState;

// Create a new dominoes game state
let mut game_state = DominoesGameState::new();

// Initialize the game
game_state.initialize();
game_state.setup_dominoes();
game_state.deal_dominoes(4); // Deal to 4 players

// Check game status
if !game_state.is_game_over() {
    let current_player = game_state.current_player();
    // Game logic here
}

// Access underlying GameState if needed
let base_state = game_state.game_state();
```

## Current Implementation Status

**Note**: This crate currently provides stub implementations only. The following functionality needs to be implemented:

### Core Game State

- [ ] Domino set initialization and shuffling
- [ ] Player hand management and dealing
- [ ] Board state tracking and updates
- [ ] Turn management and player rotation

### Game Logic

- [ ] Move validation (can domino be played?)
- [ ] Domino placement on board
- [ ] Game over detection
- [ ] Winner determination and scoring

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Different dominoes game variants support
- [ ] Save/load game state functionality
- [ ] Game history and move tracking
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality

## Future Development

1. **Game Rules Implementation**: Implement actual dominoes game rules and logic
2. **Board Management**: Track domino placement and valid connection points
3. **Player Hand Tracking**: Manage each player's dominoes and remaining pieces
4. **Move Validation**: Ensure only legal moves can be made
5. **Scoring System**: Implement dominoes scoring rules
6. **Game Variants**: Support for different types of dominoes games
